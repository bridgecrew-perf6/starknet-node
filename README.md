# Starknet Node

[![deploy_node_with_balena](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13405632/158033973-3cde7cc1-9596-4a4e-bcfe-2221b733df22.svg)](https://dashboard.balena-cloud.com/deploy?repoUrl=https://github.com/OdysLam/starknet-node)

The easiest way to deploy a Starknet Node on a Raspberry pi and begin verifying L2 state transitions, directly from your Raspberry Pi!

- Click on "Deploy Node with balena"
- Create a balena-cloud account
- In the "Create and deploy to fleet" modal, choose your default device type (e.g Raspberry Pi 400)
- Click on "Create and Deploy"
- Click on "Add a device"
- Click on "Flash" and follow the instructions to download and install balena Etcher.
- If Etcher doesn't open automatically with our OS loaded, click the arrow in the button and download balenaOS
- Follow the instructions of the modal to "flash" the OS in the storage medium (e.g SD card)
- Click on "Wifi + Ethernet" in the "Network Connection" section of the modal. Type the credentials of your wifi network. That way, the device will connect automatically to wifi
- Insert the card to the Raspbery pi, connect power + ethernet (if you didn't configure wifi)
- Let it boot ðŸ”œ
- Visit balena-cloud and view the logs of the device

balena will automatically build the application from the repository, package it into Docker containers and deliver it to your Raspberry pi to run it. The fact that the application is compiled in cloud servers and then delivered to the device, means that the build process is **much** faster than compiling on the device itself.

You can also manage your device via balena-cloud:

## Services

- `starknet-node`: The starknet node. You can access it's RPC on port `9545`.
- `netdata`: The monitoring agent. A detailed per-second view of device. You can access the dashboard on port `19999`. The agent is offline and transmits no information to any cloud.

## Environment Variables

- `ETH_RPC_URL`: Ethereun endpoint url. e.g `https://eth-mainnet.gateway.pokt.network/v1/XXXXXXX`. Currently the API endpoint is provided and sponsored by Starkware.
- `RPC_URL`: IP and port at which the node accepts RPC requests. Default: `0.0.0.0:9545`
- `ETH_PASSWORD`: Password for the ethereum endpoint. Default is empty.
- `IDLE`: Helper env variable that will idle the `starknet-pathfinder` container instead of running pathfinder. That way, you can `ssh` into the container and debug/test. Default: `0`.
- `LOCATION`: If `ON`, the device pings on regular intervals a website owned and operated by Starkware. This is done so that the approximate location of the Node may be infered from the HTTP request. Starkware uses this information to create a map of Starknet Nodes, emphasizing the importance of being able to run a node without the need of powerful hardware. It's an effort to show that Starknet is decentralized in a very important way, being able to be verified by thousand of small devices from various parts of the world. Starkware is not sharing this information with no 3rd party and the actual HTTP request does not transmit any information about the device. The inference of the location of the device is solely based on the IP that the HTTP request originates from.

## Test a new device

It's very easy to test a device that is not shown in the list of supported devices.

Follow the instructions and at the following modal, simply search your device (e.g Raspberry pi 3) and choose the 64bit version of the OS (there is a 64 in the name).

Install it normally and then go back to your balena cloud dashboard and see the logs window. If everything works as expected, come back to this repository and open an issue to let me know. I will add the device to the list of supported ones!

You may want to explore **boot from SSD**, as that would speed-up considerably the process of syncing. The greatest bottleneck in a Raspberry pi is the SD card, which not only is slower than an SSD, but also prone to corruptions.
